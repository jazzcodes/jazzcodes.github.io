### Individual Sections Taking Whole of My Attention #T4FEM

So, task 4 have been put together since Friday and after a break of 2 days, we worked on sorting the individual sections. After following the approach of making layouts using flexbox as suggested by my mentor, I decided to learn about it further. So, I studied a complete guide related to it and implemented whole of the task again separately my way and then replaced it, just in order to know whether I can use flexbox myself all alone! 

So, this time I made individual sections -
1. header
2. main - hero and review
3. footer

However, there are 2 issues being faced -
1. spacing issues -
the heading needs to be a bit to the right, overlapping the image of the phone
however, when I shift the whole block, it's alignment with the suite logo on the top is altered 
and I can't shift the heading only since it's alignment with the content below it would alter
so, my approach was to increase the font-size of the heading, increase the max-width so that the text overflows it's container and can be placed over the img next but the text isn't going out of the div

2. decoratives -
the arc (decorative) and the blur (purple gradient) in the review section which is located below the hero section aren't getting positioned - the desktop part is being applied to mobile/tablet or vice-versa (only one style is being applied) but I need different for different versions


Issues 1 is the priority that needs to be worked on for now.
Will finally complete it by tomorrow hopefully!
