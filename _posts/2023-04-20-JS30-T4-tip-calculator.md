# JS30 T4 and Tip Calculator App

Today, I completed task 4 of JS30 which was basically an array lesson.
Topics I learned:
1. filter method -> returns based on a condition 
2. map method -> returns all the values, length remains same
3. sort -> can be sorted in asc/desc
4. reduce -> for repeated actions/returning an object etc.

The problems were based on an array of objects / array of strings and we needed to extract different information even from the strings i.e parts of strings using methods like `split()`.

Overall, it was array coding cardio as the name of the challenge suggests. Understood the video and performed the same exercise myself.

These have been already studied in the JS Course but this was an elaborated version where the problems were more complex and then we also did an exercise related to a data given on a website (web scraping).

code is given [here](https://github.com/jazzcodes/JS-30/tree/T4).

Further, I started another FEM task which is a [tip calculator app](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/tip-calculator-app-ugJNGbJUX/hub).

I've followed the mobile-first approach and designed the interface for mobile as well as desktop till now.

Tomorrow I'll act on functionality and continue tasks of JS30.

Bye, Bye!
