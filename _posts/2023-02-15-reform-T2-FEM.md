# Reformation - Task 2 Clipboard Landing Page

Yesterday, I worked on the task - 2 from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/). I was given an [exercise](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/clipboard-landing-page-5cc9bccd6c4c91111378ecb9). However, I feel that there were some reformations that needed to be made since I found some components faulty owing to the top down approach again. So, to make a habit of following bottom up approach - component by component, I decided to attempt the task again, this time making the components first.

These are the steps taken to perform the activity:
1. Installed the zip folder containing necessary details - images, icons, style guide
2. Used GIMP in Manjaro to find out the dimensions (widths/heights) of different components (P.S No figma/sketch file available in basic version, it's a pro feature in Frontend Mentor).
3. Designing different components - buttons, header, footer, different feature lists - with and without icons and many more.
4. Putting them all together

I have almost made it, however there are certain problems in the footer I need to fix (idk why footer is always a problematic child for me!):
1. One footer item order in the grid
2. Color of footer icons on hover state


The link to the project can be found [here](https://master--lucky-pika-169b6c.netlify.app/) and the supporting code [here](https://github.com/jazzcodes/clipboard-landing-page-T2-FEM).

That's all for today, will continue tomorrow!
