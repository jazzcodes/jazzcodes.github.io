# Project Day-3 Configurations 

Tasks done are as follows:

- Netlify deployment   

This is done since individual PR deployment links weren't available in github. However, there are deployment preview links in case of netlify.

- Configure ESLint with airbnb config  

This was done via reading some articles & yt video on The Traversy Media channel. We can't find everything from a single source.

- Configure SCSS

There was a dire need to use scss over css coz of it's far more advanced features.
This [guide](https://blog.devgenius.io/use-sass-on-your-plain-html-css-js-projects-4f09de547f8a) was followed. Basically it creates a .scss file & complies it into css file.

- Smaller tasks

1. adding files to .gitignore. Initially, this wasn't working since the files to be ignored had already been tracked. 

The following commands solved the problem:

`git rm -r --cached node_modules
git commit -m "removing node_modules"`

2. changing the structure - but this made things haywire. So, pausing it for now.

- supabase issues 

RLS was needed to be disabled for the table to make it publicly readable & writable. The fetching & insertion worked perfectly fine after this disable.

- to-do list
This is to be started yet.
