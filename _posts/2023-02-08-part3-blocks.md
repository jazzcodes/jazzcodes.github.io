## In Progress (27/46)

It's day 3 for Part-3. It's completed till Blocks now. Today I learnt the designing of the following components:

1. Media Objects - Icons combined with some informational text

2. Quotes - using pseudo-selectors to add quotation marks before and after the quotes

3. Grids - implementing varied grids to design layouts of components

4. Testimonials - designing testimonials using grid templates and quotes are incorporated here as well.

5. Callouts - again implemented using grid and various other properties are used to get these correct according to the given design

6. Collapsables - an interesting feature implemented using a javascript code snippet, a cool transition applied - when header is clicked (expanded), the text associated becomes visible and certain changes in the icon is observed. Same is observed when the content is collapsed.

7. Blocks - these are the elements observed in different backgrounds and clipped shapes (skewed blocks) that have the capacity to accomodate other content in them.

Hope to complete with these components by tomorrow, so that other essential tasks like putting these components together can be done successfully.
