## Finished! (46/46)

It's day 6 for Part-3. Today I have finished with it and learnt the following:

1. Troubleshooting of all the components that were creating layout issues

2. Adding animations using Animations on Scroll (AOS)

3. Search Engine Optimization using meta tags and Open Graph Protocol

4. HTML and CSS Validation, clearing all the warnings

5. Building using Parcel and deployment using netlify

6. Assessing the website's performance using lighthouse and correcting the parts that needed attention.

So, I'm elated at the completion of Part-3 and with this the WebD Fundamentals (HTML & CSS) comes to an end. This has truly given me a lot of confidence and I can now make chamges to Cattish and design it more effectively and confidently!
