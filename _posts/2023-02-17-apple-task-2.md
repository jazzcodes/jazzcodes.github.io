# Day-2 Apple Task - (Condition - Severe)

This is day 2 for the apple task. It's quite challenging. It is not as easy as it seems ! :|

Today I created the following components:
1. Collapsibles - Search
2. Collapsibles - Menu
3. Putting it together (an unsuccessful attempt)
  
The collapsibles are posing a lot of issues, will complete it by tomorrow.
Other issues in the Clipboard task have come up, need to deal with those too by tomorrow.
