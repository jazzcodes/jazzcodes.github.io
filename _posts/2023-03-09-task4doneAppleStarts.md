### One Task Ends and Another Starts

Today, I finally completed task 4. I solved the mobile version issues, spacing issues, etc. I'm feeling good, more because I'd start new task now ðŸ˜› 
On a serious note - I'm happy about the journey of this task, one of the major changes being starting the task using grid and finishing it up using flexbox, furthermore, I actually used min and max widths in most of the elements which I didn't use to do before. Learnt a lot of things as a whole - designing rough layout first, then putting in the components side by side, etc. Also, one more soft skill added to my skillset - patience

Now, since I have learnt a lot in the previous tasks, we decided to take up the Apple task that has caused trouble to me earlier. This time we decided to make a proper layout. I've made a blueprint of the task according to the [figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/lVV0fvZhp0x5fS5ZQk8M9Q/Apple-Watch-Store-Landing-Page-Design-(Community)?node-id=0%3A1&t=bKCloTEIrD5i2x1f-0). Progress till now can be found below:
