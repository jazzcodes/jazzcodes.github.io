### Sayonara, ChatApp!

Finally, completed the [ChatApp](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/chat-app-css-illustration-O5auMkFqY) task by working on the exact colors as given in the design, padding issues and horizontal scroll issue that occurred due to the extra margin of the main section.

The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/jazzcodes/chat-app-css-illustration-T3-FEM).
The site is active [here](https://harmonious-rabanadas-d7aa6a.netlify.app/).

Further, in order to review and reform the process I'm following in making the designs, my mentor provided me with some useful resources that would help me to use better techniques.

2. https://web.dev/learn/design/

Today I went through the first one. Learnt some new things -
1. usage of `margin-block` and `margin-inline` in newer CSS
2. usage of `width:min()` in newer CSS
3. usage of `flex-basis:100%` to allot equal space to contents in a flex-box with flex-direction as column
4. usage of `+` to select specific siblings before a particular element if they exist and setting margins

Will do the 2nd task tomorrow and would work on [task 4](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/suite-landing-page-tj_eaU-Ra) after studying it.
