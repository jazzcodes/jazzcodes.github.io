### Portfolio in Progress

Going forward with the tasks, we decided to make a portfolio design as it would be handy for my personal use as well. SO, after some research my mentor put forward the [design](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1191026033275812161). It's basically a comprehensive design consisting of mobile, tablet and desktop versions along with dark theme and light theme. But to avoid complexity at this stage, we decided to go forward with a single theme.

So, to begin I made the layout first using the mobile-first approach. The responsiveness was taken into account from the very beginning. The sections made were -
1. Header
2. Main - Hero, Projects
3. Footer

After this, I started working on the header component first and one new thing I learnt was how to use gradients as the backgrounds of the fonts.
Will continue this task further and I plan to design hero of this task by tomorrow.
