# Project Day-2 Supabase and Routing

- tried to implement routing

Tried implementing routing in the 9 dots global menu in the dashboard.
Routing for SPAs in vanilla JS was tried. It worked well locally, however it creates problems on deployment via githib pages or netlify.

- tried supabase for fetching & inserting data

Tried implementing supabase on my todo app. However, I've been facing issue while fetching the data from the table & inserting it. The connection, however, wa screated successfully.

- dashboard menu & global menu created

This was the very first task done. And this was added to all the app pages.

P.S: the above url isn't working now, since we shifted the project to netlify
