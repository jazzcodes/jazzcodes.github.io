# Task-2 Clipboard Landing Page

Today, I worked on the task - 2 again from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/). I was given an [exercise](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/clipboard-landing-page-5cc9bccd6c4c91111378ecb9).

These are the steps taken to perform the activity:
1. Installed the zip folder containing necessary details - images, icons, style guide
2. Used GIMP in Manjaro to find out the dimensions (widths/heights) of different components (P.S No figma/sketch file available in basic version, it's a pro feature in Frontend Mentor).
3. Coding Coding and Coding

I have almost made it, however there are certain problems I need to fix:
1. Spacing issues
2. Optimization using OOPS (CSS)
3. Footer 

The link to the project can be found [here](https://master--lucky-pika-169b6c.netlify.app/) and the supporting code [here](https://github.com/jazzcodes/clipboard-landing-page-T2-FEM).

That's all for today, will continue tomorrow!
