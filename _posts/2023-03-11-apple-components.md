### Components Done 

Yesterday, I fixed the layout issues. Today, I worked on designing the individual components. So, I made the following -
1. Main Section
- Header

  Consisting of an apple icon and a search & cart icon
  
- Hero Section

  Consisting of a title made responsive for mobile, tablet and desktop versions. And an image of a watch and a color indicator (used flexbox here).
  Also, the desktop version has a page-indicator and a set of three watches in a list. Used `display` and `opacity` properties to make it visible in the    desktop and hide it in the other versions.
  
2. Footer 

 Consists of a menu icon and a list of social media icons. The list is vertically aligned when on desktop and tablet while it's horizontally aligned when it's on mobile.
 
 The main components have been designed. Now I need to work on the collapsible items - the menu on the left in the mobile/ top in the desktop and the search field in the mobile & the desktop. I'll do this on Monday positively.
