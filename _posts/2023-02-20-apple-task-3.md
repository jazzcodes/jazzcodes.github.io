# One bad apple spoils the whole barrel :(

This is the third day of making changes in the task of designing the Apple Watch Landing Page. 
Made some changes in the collapsibles-
1. Search (invisible in the mobile version)
2. Vertical Menu (invisible in the desktop version)

Still facing other issues -
For desktop version, was able to solve some issues (it looks nearly same now) but mobile version is still troublesome. Following are the major issues being faced-

- Desktop

   the nav items on hover width isn't fixed, I tried to set it explicitly but not working
   This has been solved using the following pointers as suggested by a mentor in my organization-
   1. removing width from `.menu li`
   2. setting width `100%` on `.menu ul` and `.menu`
   3. adding some padding on `.menu a`.
   
   But still some problems have further arisen-
   the menu on mobile isn't working as before, like the design demanded the complete bg of the hovered item to be changed to blue , but now it's localized upto the width of the `li` only.

- Mobile

  1. overall width of the grid is bigger and is not taking the default screen size ( I think it's taking the grid size of the desktop part).
  2. the menu toggler contents occur below the toggler icon on expansion despite of being written before the icon in the html code (this worked well    individually). 
  3. horizontal social media icons placement (not visible). 
   
 Will work further on these issues tomorrow with the assistance of my mentor!
