# Day 2 - ChatApp Task

Moving on with yesterday's [ChatApp design](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/chat-app-css-illustration-O5auMkFqY) I further made the following components -

1. notch
2. top part of the app
3. matter (heading and content)
4. mobile screen
5. grid

Fun Fact - Used scale feature to reduce the size of mobile for the desktop version and guess what? whole of the components inside scaled accordingly! 
Was really happy to see the things change, coz otherwise changing individual components would have required a lot of efforts :D
Need to fine-tune the task with exact colors, changes in the text messages and some positioning issues.
