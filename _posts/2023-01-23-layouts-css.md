## Layouts are fun!

<p> Today, the learning part becomes even more interesting since my metor assigned me a course that would help me dive deeper into the CSS and would ultimately help me to make effective web pages. I learnt about Layouts in CSS.</p>   
<ol>
<li> <b>Box Model</b> <br>
<p> Became familiar with the box model - padding, margin, content. One of the notable things were how the content is affected when padding and border properties are applied. However, when we do :

    box-sizing:border-box;

then, the content isn't affected by border/padding changes.

</p>

</li>
<li> <b>Overflow</b> <br>
<p> Whenever there is more text than the space available in the container, this property comes in handy.

    overflow:auto:

This is done to add a scrollbar which becomes visible when the user hovers over it and the content becomes accomodated in the container.

</p>
</li>
<li> <b>Measurement Units</b> <br>
<p> learnt about various mesurement units: absolute (px) and relative(em, rem,vh) and their advantages and usages in different situations.</p>
</li>
<li> <b>Positioning</b> <br>
<p> Positioning of elements - 
<ol>
<li>static: by default</li>
<li>relative: relative to it's normal position</li>
<li>absolute:relative to container</li>
<li>fixed: relative to viewport</li>
</ol>

</p>
<li> <b>Float</b> <br>
<p> Float is used to float/place a text around an element such as an image. We need to use clear fix to avoid parent collapsing here.</p>
</li>

<li> <b>Flex-Box</b> <br>
<p> It's a very easy way to create navigation menus and other layouts on web pages. It has various container properties such as display, jusify-content, align-content, etc and certain other flex-items properties to style the items in a flex container.</p>
</li>
<li> <b>Grid</b> <br>
<p> It's used to craete image galleries, layout of web pages and many more. It's a detailed topic and is very powerful and useful in styling.</p>
</li>
<li> <b>Media Queries</b> <br>
<p> These help in making responsive websites so that the code behaves differently based on the display properties.</p>
</li>

<p>Again, in order to refine what I learnt, I also covered the exercises given at the end of the course along with practising alongside covering each topic ( as suggested by my mentor!) </p>

Byes!
