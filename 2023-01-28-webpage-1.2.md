## Cattish- You Know What It Is!

<p>
The second day it is, full of turns and twists must say! Let's hop in directly into the workflow.
</p>

<ol>
<li> <b>Step-1</b>
<br>
Created the webpages for other two cards in the 'Services' section -<b> Adopt a Cat </b>and <b>Bless Us With One. Added form submissions in both these pages. </b>
</li>
<br>
<li> <b>Step-2</b>
<br>
Hopped into the About Us section and created a card for the text to be displayed along with adding some cat images on its top to create a good visual effect. 
</li>
<br>
<li> <b>Step-3</b>
<br>
Created a footer (containing contact details) on the home page and linked the 'Contact' to the footer of the page.
</li>
</ol>
<br>
Things to work on:
<ol>
<li> How to link every page to the footer of the home page (if Contact is a part of navigation menu on every page)?</li>
<li> How to fix the footer placement issues on every page?</li>
<li>Link issues on the last two cards
</li>
<li>The most important one - adding responsiveness (this wwas supposed to be the first step rather than being the last one!- Grateful to my mentor that he enlightned me regarding this!)
</li>
<br>
The next step is to work on these things before starting the next task!

<br>
Till then good bye!
