# Project Day-6 Dealing with Issues

So, on the 6th day, the following things were done:

1. npm (webpack) was installed & dist folder was created 
2. Sticky Notes frontend was created. The database connection was tried but that led to connection error in to-do list also.

   So, for now just front-end is designed & add note displays a note that can be edited

   PR can be found [here](https://github.com/jazzcodes/ProductivityZap/pull/7)
   deployment can be found [here](https://deploy-preview-7--luxury-hotteok-fb50c4.netlify.app/pages/sticky-notes.html)
   
3. SCSS issues were tried to be resolved-> import not working so.. using one css file for all pages for now.
4. supabase issues were tried to be resolved by installing supabase using npm. But that didn't solve it as the error was related to too many requests & the dashboard was also not showing my projects now.

That's it.. Bye!
