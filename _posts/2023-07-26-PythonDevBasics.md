## Python Programming for Developers - Another World

Currently, I am taking up a course to learn python programming. I would be taking notes and writing the experiences here as I go through this course. 

Firstly, let's get comfortable with the language.

### Getting Started
**Why Python?**
The reasons:
1. Python solves complex problems in a fewer lines of code.
2. Python is multi-purpose. It can be used for - data analysis, artificial intelligence and macine learning, automation, web apps, mobile applications, desktop apps, testing and hacking.
3. Then it's a high-level language, we don't need to worry about memory management as in C++.
4. It's cross-platform i.e we can make apps for different platforms such as android, ios, etc.
5. Huge community of developers
6. Large ecosystem - libraries, frameworks, packages, etc.
