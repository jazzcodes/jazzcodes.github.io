# DOM - The Final Day

So, yesterday I was able to complete 2 DOM Projects listed in the video course. Today, following the course further, I finally completed the next three courses, thus completing the course. 

The following is the progress:

**1. Accordian**

   This was the project that I understood yesterday itself but implemented today. It was quite a challenge because, the `toggle()` method wasn't much clearly explained in the video and it required deeper understanding of the concept in order to implement, otherwise that was giving `TypeError` of `undefined` due to the list returned by `getElementsByClassName()`. So, we need to iterate over the items to make the accordian work.
   
      accordian[i].addEventListener("click", function()
    {
        this.classList.toggle('active');
        let answer = document.getElementsByClassName('answer');
        console.log(answer);
                if(answer[i].style.display==='block')
        {
            answer[i].style.display='none';
        }
        else{
            answer[i].style.display='block';
        }
    }); // Changing style of answer was also not in the video, had to be discovered, hehe nice tho! coz this gives a different level of satisfaction when solved :D .....

  **2. The Tinker Bell Timer**

This stop watch covered the concepts of using setInterval method in JS and using string methods to fulfill the requirements. Overall, I faced no such issue in implementation and it worked according to the video itself.

**3. Darky To-Do**

It's a to-do list with functionalities to add a task (as expected) and checking the items when finished and deletion of tasks if we wish to delete the task. This task also didn't cause any issue as such and was quite interesting to implement.

 Code can be found [here](https://github.com/jazzcodes/DOM/tree/master/Projects/Project-5).

 That's it for today, and tomorrow I'll start a new task to implement all that I've learnt about JavaScript till now!
