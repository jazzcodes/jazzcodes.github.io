<p>Layouts are an important concept in web development. To get a strong hold of this topic, my mentor provided links to some games that would help me to understand the layouts in a better and more interactive way.  </p>

<p>Following are the links: </p>

<li> <a href="https://codepip.com/games/grid-garden/">Mastery Games</a>

</ol>
