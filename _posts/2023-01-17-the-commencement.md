## The Commencement of my Journey at Ryaz

<p> I have immense pleasure to share that today is my first official day of industrial training at Ryaz which is a tech organisation helping various people to build their ideal websites and provides solutions to make their dream ventures a success. I came to know about it through one of my classmates who has been contributing in the community for quite a long time. I'm obliged that I got a chance to work here and learn among such a friendly community of developers. </p>

<p> My mentor, Mandeep conducted the very first meeting via gmeet after some online interactions. He made me familiar with the work culture and other important know-hows necessary for the smooth functioning of the training process. He then assigned me tasks to be completed by today. Following are the tasks and my solutions:
</p>
1. <b>Sharing the Laptop Configuration</b> <br>
Laptop Configuration <br>
Shortcut(Ctrl+Shift+Esc) <br>
CPU - Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-6006U CPU @ 2.00GHz <br>
RAM - 4.0 GB <br>
Storage - 224 GB <br>
GPU - Intel(R) HD Graphics 520 <br>

2. <b>Setting Up Blog for Daily Diary</b> <br>
Referred https://chadbaldwin.net/2021/03/14/how-to-build-a-sql-blog.html and followed the steps to create a blog environment using the same template.
<br>

3. <b>Installing Linux OS</b>
<br>
This is due since I need to study properly about the steps and take the backup of the existing files in the Windows OS.
