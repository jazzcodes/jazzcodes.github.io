### Day 4 Module 4

It's day 4 and I'm currently on the 4th module of the JavaScript guide. I've studied 6 topics and 2 are left. The module is about objects: the basics.

Following are the topics.
1. objects - declaration and basic stuff related to objects
2. Object references and copying - clones, deep cloning concept studied
3. Garbage collection - an automatic process, concept of reachables studied in detail along with other optimizations of the practice
4. Object methods, "this" - run-time selection
5. Constructor, operator "new" - to create different objects easily
6. Optional chaining '?.' - to check whether the object on left exists or it is undefined/null.

This time I did exercises on the plunker website link attached to each task and I'll upload it on my repository soon.

Alongside, planned to fix the portfolio issues. Implemented mobile menu by referring web, Just need to change the icon style as per the design.
Tried changing the left and right spacing, will work on it tomorrow again.

Also, planned to solve extra problems of JS to get good hold of the concepts being taught in the documentation.

Byees!
