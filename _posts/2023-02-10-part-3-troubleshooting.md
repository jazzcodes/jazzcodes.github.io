## In Progress (38/46)

It's day 5 for Part-3. Today I learnt the designing of the following components:

1. Footer - It used collapsibles on mobile displays while a completely different layout in desktop displays along with different placement of brand logo

2. Putting it All Together - Combined all the components together semantically

3. Troubleshooting - This is one of the major parts to be conquered - various design issues can be encountered. I have to deal with Plans, Showcase Block and CallOut layout issues and I am working on them

- Plans - Three blocks not appearing in the same row
- Showcase Block - Content Placement issues
- CallOut - size issues

Currently, working on these. So, hopefully will be able to complete Part-3 by tomorrow positively!
