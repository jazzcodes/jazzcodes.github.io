### Starting Off with JavaScript :D

Yeah, so this one's coming straight outta my heart.

Today, I'm really very happy to begin with JavaScript i.e the next phase of my training. I've always wanted to master the programming aspect and I'm so grateful that I'm pursuing my training here at Ryaz as I'd never thought that I'd be able to learn development seriously owing to a few attempts when I started doing it on my own during lockdown. I'm grateful for the growth, the accountability that I like to learn without saying and the fact that I realise my goals I make for myself is the best feeling. 

So, today I started with JavaScript, I'm learning it whole-heartedly. Currently, my state of mind is to learn each and every aspect of the [guide](https://javascript.info/) shared by my mentor. 

The first day's task was to complete till 2.18 but I could do till 2.10 but I'm completely okay with it coz learning takes time and the point is learning.

The manual is a comprehensive guide about JavaScript. Part-1 deals with JavaScript as a language. Part-2 deals with functioning of JavaScript in the browser and finally the Part-3 deals with additiona concepts related to the language.

Started off with Part-1 today.
First, Introduction dealt with evolution of the language, editors, specifications and developer console (Press F12 to see it).

Second is a well explained portion about Fundamentals of JS
Learnt about the following:
1. Writing simple programs
2. Code Structures - statements, blocks , etc
3. "use strict" to use modern and modified version of older version
4. variables - let, const
5. data types - primitive (number, string, bigInt, boolean, null, undefined, symbols) and non-primitive (objects)
6. Interaction: alert, prompt, confirm
7. type conversions 
8. basic operators, maths
9. comparisons (found very important concepts inside it )
10. conditional branching using if and ? (ternary operator)

So, in a nutshell, I feel I'm getting there and yes this guide is way too comprehensive would take a lot of time to digest and learn but I feel that gonna be worth it :)
