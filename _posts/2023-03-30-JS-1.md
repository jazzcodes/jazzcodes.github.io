### Starting Again: Basic JavaScript FCC

Today, I've continued the [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/) challenges for hands-on practice of what I've learnt so far in the javascript.info guide.

Some of the interesting points I learnt in the 113 challenges of the module are:
1. Arrays are mutable unlike strings, values of the entries can be changed even if the array is declared as constant.
2. Global variables are defined outside the function. These can also be defined inside without declaring them with `let`/`var` but this isn't ideal and might create complications.
3. When function doesn't return anything, it returns `undefined`.
4. When two variables are compared using relational operators, their values are first converted i.e Type Coercion/ Type Conversion is done. However, in strict operators, this isn't performed.
5. `!=` and `!==` are different. The latter one is strictly not equal to.
6. `switch` does strict equality test in all its cases.
7. The properties in objects can be of any type but they are ultimately converted into string type only,
8. We can write object property without `""` but these are compulsory while using names including spaces.

Currently, I've done all the Basic JavaScript part (Yayyyyyyyy!). And will move on to the other sections tomorrow!

Till then, Byeeess!
