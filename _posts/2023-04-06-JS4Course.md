# Day 4 JS Course

Started with the next module in Part-2 of the course. 

Following are the topics learnt:

##  1. Prototypical Inheritance

   ### 1. Creating your own Prototypical Inheritance
   
   - Basically, suppose we have 2 objects - circle and square and we want to create some prototypical functions for the two, so instead of repeating the code separately for the two, we're going to create another object shape and have a prototypical function here which can be inherited by the circle and square.
  
  This is pretty easy. Understand the hierarchy:
  
  -> Shape > ShapeBase > ObjBase
  -> Circle > CircleBase > ObjBase
  
  We can explicitly let circle object inherit from ShapeBase using the following:
  This means Circle Base inherits from Shape Base, it's going to both the object's members access.
  
  `Circle.prototype = Object.create(Shape.prototype)`

Initially, it was:
  
  `Circle.prototype = Object.create(Object.prototype)`
  
 ### 2. Resetting the Constructor 
   
   Whenever we reset a prototype, reset the constructor as well.
   Consider the above example only.
   **Shape** (parent)
   `Shape.prototype.constructor = Shape
   new Shape.prototype.constructor () is same a new Shape()`
   **Circle** (child)
   `new Circle.prototype.constructor() calls new Shape()` since it is set to `Shape` coz of inheritance.
   Therefore, reset constructor using -
   `Circle.prototype.constructor = Circle`
