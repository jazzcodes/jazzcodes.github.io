## Part-3 Lezzz Go!

Part-3 of the course has a lot of components to deal with. Firstly, it started with all the pre-requisites needed to complete the course. Then, it taught all the essential skills required - Photoshop, git, etc. Also, it showed how to set up project and make teh workspace more productive by using different extensions (Editor: VS CODE).

The most interesting thing that I felt I was missing out when I tried my hands on creating webpage initially was working on/designing different components separately and using OOPS in the process.

So, the course instructed to use mobile and desktop photoshop designs to find out the necessary markup details - padding, color, font, etc. Also, we use mobile-first approach here i.e making the the web app mobile responsive first, then taking desktop versions into account side by side.

Starting with the components, we dealt with the typography part first. Then, identified links in the design and wrote css and markup for them. Lastly, we worked on the badges being observed on the webpage.

Will start other components tomorrow! Much more to learn.
