# Last 3 Weeks of the Project!

## Project Day 7
Following are the tasks done:

1. supabase issues -> concluded that we would pause this for a while & begin with the functionalities that do not require a database first. Though, the solutions to the issues are stated [here](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/troubleshooting#under-provisioned-resources).
2. studied about SCSS from this [guide](https://blog.logrocket.com/the-definitive-guide-to-scss/).
3. converted the css code into scss using nesting, variables & mixins.
4. pomodoro -> referred my timer task done in early DOM learning videos and reversed it's functionality to amke it work as required. working on some conflicts & then I'll begin with sticky notes, this time without any database.

deployment of progress till now can be viewed [here](https://deploy-preview-8--luxury-hotteok-fb50c4.netlify.app/pages/pomodoro.html).
