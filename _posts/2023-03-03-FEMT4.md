### Task 4 - Layout's the Key


I started the [task 4](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/suite-landing-page-tj_eaU-Ra) yesterday. However, there were some layout issues in my grid approach. So, with the help of my mentor, I designed the layout using flexbox, created a blueprint first and then added the elements in the individual sections.

1. Header section contained logo and a button
2. Main section is divided into two -
    - hero section containing feature list, an image and group of other elements
    - review section containing an image and a review
3. Footer containing logo, copyright details and social media icons list

The overall sections have been made, however, there is a dire need to pay attention to the individual sections in order to make it look exactly similar to the design in the challenge.

The code is available [here](https://github.com/jazzcodes/suite-landing-page-T4-FEM) and the site is live [here](https://master--lively-sfogliatella-2eeb29.netlify.app/).
