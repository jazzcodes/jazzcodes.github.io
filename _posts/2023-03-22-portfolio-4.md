### Oops, Not Finished Yet!
 
My task was almost finished but some points were noticed by my mentor which I am grateful for since these details matter and eventually help you become a 
really good frontend developer. 

Worked on the following pointers:

1. Project section spacing on desktop
2. Project images were shrinking, so I set `object-fit:cover`
3. Images were too heavy to load, so we optimized images. I used compression which I feel isn't a good fix but yes works
4. Made a new page for project section so that I can add other projects over there and show some of them on the home page itself
5. Fonts were fixed
6. The projects links were made to open in a new tab
7. Added a strip design below the hero section
8.  UX was improved by allowing the user to click the whole highlighted colorful container instead of just tapping on the text (which would be harder to do on a mobile screen) as suggested by my mentor


Just horizontal spacing part is left to work on, we have decided to move on to javascript part along with working on this issue side by side.
