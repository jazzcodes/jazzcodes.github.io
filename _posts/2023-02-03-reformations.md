## Cattish - Reformations

So, after being well-versed with Part-2 of the course, we realized that the webpage - Cattish needs certain modifications and improvements. Some of the pointers are listed below:

1. To implement BEM (Block Level Modifier)
2. To make it responsive (The most significant part)
3. To use grids for layout
4. To solve the footer issues
5. To implement the 'service' cards

- use flex-box
- resolve link issues

6. To avoid all relative random positioning and use grid or other methods for correct placement of images and content boxes

So, after listing the changes, we made a rough sketch of how I wanted the webpage to look like. Initially, I focused on the home page (mobile and desktop). Then, I started with the implementation from scratch.

The progress can be viewed [here](https://github.com/jazzcodes/cattish.github.io) .
