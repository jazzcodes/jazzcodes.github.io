# Moving On - ChatApp Task

The previous task was a bit tedious and complex. So my mentor suggested to complete a couple of simpler tasks to get a better understanding of the concepts. The next task I chose was the [ChatApp design](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/chat-app-css-illustration-O5auMkFqY).

I made the following components:

1. blocks 
2. images-grid
3. outgoing text
4. incoming text
5. input group
6. poll

The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/jazzcodes/chat-app-css-illustration-T3-FEM).
Just 2 components and putting together of the stuff is left which I would complete tomorrow.
