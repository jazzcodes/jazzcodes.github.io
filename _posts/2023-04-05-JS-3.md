### JS Course Day 3, Part-2 Begins!

Today, I started with the exercises of the Part-1 of the course. It took a considerable amount of time to implemented the exercises carefully.

The exercises can be found [here](https://github.com/jazzcodes/JSCourse).

Then, I began with the Part-2 of the course that is related to Object Oriented Programming principles (OOPS) in JavaScript.

Following are the topics covered till now -

1. Basics
- 4 Pillars of OOPS -> Encapsulation, Inheritance, Abstraction, Polymorphism

2. Objects -> this was almost same as the previous parts' module. But some newer concepts learnt are-
- Private properties and methods - Abstraction, concept of closure and did the exercise side by side

3. Prototypes
- Inheritance - Classical & Prototypical
- Multilevel Inheritance, built-in objects 
- Property attributes/descriptors 
- Constructor prototypes -> as functions are also objects, the constructor functions also have prototypes as in the case of objects
- Prototype and Instance members
- Iterating properties -> `Objects.keys(obj)` is used to iterate over instance/own properties while `for(let key in obj)` is used to iterate over instance as well as prototype values. `.hasOwnProperty(obj)` returns `true` when instnace property is passed while it returns `false` when prototype property is passed.
- Avoid extending built-in objects to avoid conflicts/errors.

Will complete the exercise of this module as well as cover other modules tomorrow.

Till then, byeeees!
