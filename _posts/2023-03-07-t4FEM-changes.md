### Focused on the Deets

Today, I tried to fix the layout font sizes, spacing, etc by comparing with the design more carefully in order to bring in better accuracy. After careful observation, my mentor made me familiar with some issues that still existed with the design. So, I worked on the following areas in order to fix those points -

1. Headings 
Changed the heading font, split it into 2 paragraphs, did `white-space:nowrap` on the individual paragraphs in order to get that overflow, overlap effect over the image next to the text. Also, changed the font-size of the content associated with the headings. All these changes demanded spacing alterations of button too.

2. Header
Changed max-width and min-width in header in order to align it vertically with the remaining content on the page.

3. Images
Changed the hero image's size so that it matches the vertical alignment setting

4. Features
Changed the positioning of the feature list

5. Review 
Changed the position of jeremy's image, fixed min-width and max-width of the review section on different dimensions of the screen

6. Footer
Footer overlap with the review sectiin changed and vertical alignment taken into consideration

Some things still need to be changed - the decoratives mainly
