## In Progress (35/46)

It's day 4 for Part-3. Today I learnt the designing of the following components:

1. Navigation Menu - This was one of the trickiest components to build because it had a completely different layout to be displayed in different devices. The collapsibles are also used over here.

2. Hero - Designed the banner or hero using grids

3. Optimizing Images - Used 1x, 2x images for optimization because the optimized images have far less size as compared to the previous ones.

4. Domains Block - Designed domains block that used newer grid concepts like auto-fit, minmax.

5. Plans Block- Designed Plans block that displays 3 plans aligned vertically in mobile displays and horizontally in tablet and desktop displays.

6. Features Block- displays features and pseudo-elements are used to swap elements of alternate content items.

7. Showcase Block- shows all the features that stand-out. Media-Objects are used here.

8. Testimonials Block - this was pretty simple as here the testimonial component that has been built already, was incorporated in a block and a container.

Looking forward to put these components together!
