# JS-30 & FEM Go Hand in Hand 

Today, started with the centering text issue in the yesterday's task i.e interative rating component.
Tried to fix it by making the paragraph's height zero in order to remove the extra spacing given by default by the font.

Next, went on to do the [JS30](https://javascript30.com/) task 1 & 2.

The task 1 was basically about binding keyboard keys to corresponding play drumkit audios. The task was very interesting and I learnt about the `transitionend` part to remove the transition after the key is pressed. Further, leanrt about how to make the function work when one repeatedly presses the key (`audio.currenTime=0`). I used the frontend given in the starter kit itself.

The Task-2 was about a JS Clock. This was quite interesting and I designed the frontend in my way and finished the task.
Used `date` functions and `setInterval` method.

Lastly, started the FEM [task](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/age-calculator-app-dF9DFFpj-Q/hub) which is an age calculator. Just made a blueprint (started only) and would work on it next week!
