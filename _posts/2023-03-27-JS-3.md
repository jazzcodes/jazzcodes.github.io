### JS Day 3 Module 3

Today, I covered another module of the guide that was entirely related to the code quality. 

The following topics were covered -
1. Debugging in the browser - This helped to make us familiar with the Devtools related to JS. All the features - step into , step over, automatic pause etc was covered here.
2. Coding Style - Just realised, this was skipped by mistake, will do it tomorrow now
3. Comments - Importance of good comments when code isn't much descriptive but mostly we try to make the code self-descriptive
4. Ninja Code - A complete guide telling how not to write the code
5. Automated testing with Mocha - Mocha, Chai frameworks used for automated testing. This is something new for me and I feel I need to practise this as it's very important as well as seemed cool to me!
6. Polyfills and Transpilers - Used to make the updated JS work on older versions of engines

Additionally, I completed the previous tasks of 2nd Module.
Also, tried working on portfolio's menu, but couldn't achieve much success in that, so I would continue it tomorrow!
