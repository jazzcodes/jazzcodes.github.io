# Task-1 Product Preview Card Component

It is a well known saying that "Practice makes a man perfect!". So, working on it, my mentor assigned me a task from a famous website [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/). I was given an [exercise](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-preview-card-component-GO7UmttRfa) in which I needed to design a Product Preview Card and the product here is a Chanel Perfume (that's cool). 

These are the steps taken to perform the activity:
1. Installed the zip folder containing necessary details - images, icons, style guide
2. Used GIMP in Manjaro to find out the dimensions (widths/heights) of different components (P.S No figma/sketch file available in basic version, it's a pro feature in Frontend Mentor).
3. For mobile version, the things were quite easy, just special attention had to be given to the image since it's `object-fit` property was required to be set to `cover` so that it's not stretched.
4. For the desktop version, a two-column grid needed to be implemented and the image and the card content needed to be aligned accordingly with proper padding.
5. Finally, I deployed the project on netlify!

The link to the project can be found [here](https://fascinating-cannoli-d0ce73.netlify.app/) and the supporting code [here](https://github.com/jazzcodes/product-preview-card-component-T1-FEM).

Other than this activity, we decided to get well-versed with the git workflows - Feature Branch Workflow and Gitflow Workflow

## Feature Branch Workflow

If there's a project and I want to work on a particular feature of that project, I won't be able to directly make changes to the main code. I would need to make a feature branch (i.e a branch indicative of the feature I would work on) and make the necessary changes there and would push it to the central local repository. Then I would open a pull request to the project, the team would review my code and can make necessary changes or ask me to do those changes. Then after the code is ready, it would be merged to the actual code of the project. This way different people would be able to contribute in the project, without disturbing the main code.

## Gitflow Workflow

This uses similar workflow as Feature Branch Workflow just with a difference that here we create feature branches from the `develop` branch and not from the `main` branch. And similar PR process is followed here. Then the changes are merged into the `develop` branch. This results in another branch - `release` where the version can also be specified. This `release` branch is then merged to the `main` as well as `develop` branch. No changes can be made here except bug fixes or documentation part. Another branch that comes into play here is `hotfix`  which helps in fixing of bugs and the changes are then merged into `main` as well as the `develop` branch. This workflow is beneficial when a product is to be shipped and several versions of it are planned to be released. It helps in committing at a larger scale.

That's all for today, will continue tomorrow!
