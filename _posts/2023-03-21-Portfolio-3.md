### Portfolio - Notable Changes Done

Yesterday, I finished most of the work for the portfolio design. Basically, I was finished with all the essential blocks out there. However, each block needed to be made perfect by taking minute details into account.

So, we listed down the changes that needed to made and worked on the following pointers:

**MENU** 

**Mobile**

Header Button bg color different 
padding to be changed a bit 

**Tablet**

same  

**Desktop**

padding to be changed 


**HERO** 

**Mobile**

Max-width on hero heading added  
color of white text changed to a bit gray 
set a limit on image size 
buttons padding, width changed 

**Tablet**

Max-width on hero heading added 
buttons padding, width changed 
set a limit on image size  

**Desktop**

Max-width on hero heading added 
font-size of hero heading changed 
Max-width on hero__content added 
buttons padding, width changed



**PROJECTS SHOWCASE** 

**Mobile**

Changed the heading max-width to match with the design
project card's radius changed
the height of image on the project card changed

**Tablet**

Changes in heading
changes in intro of showcase

**Desktop**

Tablet changes worked here as well


**FOOTER** 

**Mobile**

Icons size changed
Fonts changed

horizontal rule's color changed

**Tablet**

spacing issues 

**Desktop**

Tablet changes worked here as well

There's a room of improvement in the menu section of the mobile - adding an 'X' button to close the mobile which I feel I'd be able to make more efficiently when I'll be learning JavaScript as the next step of our learning process.
