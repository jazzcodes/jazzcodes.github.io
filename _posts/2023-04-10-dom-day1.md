# DOM-DOM-DOM

After completion of the JavaScript course Part-1 and Part-2 and a quick revision of Arrays module, we're moving forward to DOM (Document Object Model) Manipulation by learning from a short and crisp DOM [course](https://youtu.be/5fb2aPlgoys).

Following are the things I'm learning:

## 1. DOM Overview

The document object is the built object in JS which can be used to manipulate the thing son our web pages. The DOM follows a hierarchy -> parent, child, sibings relationship. All these elements are known as nodes. Each node can have ids, classes which can be accessed as properties of these nodes, however, they do not participate in the parent-child/sibling relationships. Even the document object is a child of the Window object (browser) but here we will deal with the inner document only.
