# JS30 Task 3 and More!

Yesterday, I finished the age calculator task. However, my mentors observed a room for improvement in that and thus, I changed some conditions as the future as well as the current year were causing some notable issues.

One of the things I learnt was that by using console.log just before the associated checking condition to print the values of getYear() and it was displaying some 3 digit number instead of the current year 2023  and it then compared it with the value entered i.e 2022 in ur case for example that gave wrong output. So I searched about what value this method returns and got to know it is depracated and returns local value. Instead of this we should use getFullYear() method to get year in the format of 4 digits.

Next, started with the JS-30 Task 3 that was related to manipulating CSS variables using JS. Following are the takeaways-
1. created 3 inputs
2. learnt about dataset which is a compilation of all the data-values defined
3. using `document.documentelement.style.setProperty(x,y)` property to change the value of vaariables declared in `:root` in CSS.
4. used forEach loop to iterate over NodeList
5. learnt about scope -> local scope > global scope

Next, I have started another FEM task which is an [interactive pricing component](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-pricing-component-t0m8PIyY8).
I chose this one coz it was familiar to what I've learnt about range input type in JS30 Task.

Following is the progress again following the mobile first approach.

Will complete this and JS30 Task 4 by tomorrow.

Till then byeees! :D
