# Apple Watch Store Landing Page Design

In the previous task, I mentioned some problems that I had to deal with today. These were dealt as follows:
1. translateX() wasn't working (i feel it was more like a temporary fix), like it appeared different from the distance I applied. So, I used flexbox to center align the icons-list and the logo, also, the ul had a left-padding due to which it wasn't aligned in the middle, so removed the padding.
2. I explicitly set the dimensions of the socila media icons in the icon list initially but it wasn't required. When I removed, it looked same as the design. 

After fixing the footer issues and other minor problems in yesterday's task, I started working on another task - [Apple Watch Store Landing Page Design](https://www.figma.com/file/lVV0fvZhp0x5fS5ZQk8M9Q/Apple-Watch-Store-Landing-Page-Design-(Community)?node-id=0%3A1&t=bKCloTEIrD5i2x1f-0).

These are the steps I followed:

1. Downloaded all the necessary images from the figma file.
2. Started designing components (making them responsive alongside)-
   1. Buttons
   2. Title
   3. watch showcase
   4. watches list
   5. navigation menu

Done till here. Will complete and deploy by tomorrow positively.
