# Interactive Rating Component Task FEM - DOM

Today, we started implementation of JS & DOM via some tasks. So, I took up a [Frontend Mentor Task](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-rating-component-koxpeBUmI/hub) that consisted of making an interactive rating component that selected 1 of the ratings out of 5 and showed up another card after submission that is basically a thank you page depicting the rating given by the user.

Although, this is a newbie challenge, it was quite challenging for me as this was the first JS task that I was doing without any guided course/video. Furthermore, this task helped me to refreshen my frontend designing skills that I've learnt till now.

Before starting this task, one of my mentors came up with a suggestion to bind keyboard 'Enter" key to the 'add task' functionality of my todo list. 
So, firstly, I updated that with the following code: 

    inputTask.addEventListener("keypress", function(event)
    {
       if(event.key==="Enter")
       {
        event.preventDefault();
        addTaskBtn.click();
       }
    });
    
 After this, I moved on to complete the FEM task.
 
 So, initially my approach was that I'd make 2 pages - 1 for the rating component itself and other for the thank you card. So, I began with all of the required stuff-
 1. created mobile design for the rating component
 2. created desktop design for the rating component
 3. created mobile design for thank you card
 4. created desktop design for thank you card

Then, moved on to add JS functionality to my card component.
-> took 5 buttons by id
-> added event listeners for each button
-> in those functions, assigned the value of button to a variable named selected value

in the js file of the other page
-> imported that value
-> took span element (space left for rating selected) by id
-> set the value of span's innerText to the selected element
(Initially, I added this js in the one file only, but didn't work, so tried the above approach)

But this, didn't work and showed up TypeErrors (can't set value to null)

So, I worked on another approach and this time used one js file as well as 1 html file.

-> rating component container showed up initially
-> js as it is worked fine
-> thank you component `display` set to `none` initially
-> on submission, js code added to set thank you component's display to `block` and rating component's `display` to `none`.

That's it! Yay! :D how cool it was but initially I messed up with 2 files, not knowing how to deal with them.. :(

But now again, the centering of the text inside buttons seem to cause an issue. Tried to fix it, would look into it more deeply tomorrow
and start another task.

Till then, Byee!
