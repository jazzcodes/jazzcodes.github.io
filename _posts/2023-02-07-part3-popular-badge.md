## In Progress (20/46)

It's day 2 for Part-3. Yesterday, I completed till badges. Today I learnt the designing of the following components:

1. Lists

   1. Horizontal (Inline Lists)
   2. Vertical Lists with Icons as the bullets

2. Buttons with different variations

3. Designing text input types and grouping of these inputs with icons, buttons or other elements.

4. Designing cards with header and body

5. Adding plan information in the cards along with adding popular badge (a modifier) (a special card)

That's all for now, will continue other parts tomorrow!
