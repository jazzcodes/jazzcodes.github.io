### Debugging and More on ES6 

Yesterday, I completed ES6 from freecodecamp. Today, I learned the concept from the video related to ES6 as discussed yesterday. The video taught new concepts as well helped in revision of the older ones. 

The following are the topics covered:
1. Scope of var/let/const - var (scope limited to function), let (scope limited to block) and const (scope limited to block but can't be reassigned.
2. Objects - accessing properties using `.` when we know what to access ahead of time while  `[] ` when we don't know and we get to know about it during run-time.
3. `this` keyword returns the reference to the current object.
4. `this` works with the object only and stand-alone functions return reference to the window object or undefined when strict mode on which is by default.
5. Every function in JS is an object.
6. We can change behaviour of stand-alone functions using `.bind(obj_name)` with the method.
7. arrow functions works fine  with `this` in the callback function that acts as an argument of another function which is defined in the object's method.
8. `arr_name.map()` used to iterate over the elements of teh array. Helpful for rendering lists in React.
9. Template literals studied.
10. Object destructuring studied.
11. Spread operator  used to combine 2 arrays in addition to providing an opportunity to add elements in between too which isn't the case in `.concat()` method of arrays. It is also used to craete clone if an array. Works same with the objects.
13. Classes act as a blueprint for the objects.
14. Inheritance in classes using `extends` and calling parent class in the constructor of the child class.
15. Modules - default and named exports and imports studied

Further, studied Debugging from FCC.
The following are the topics studied and these are very easy and self-explanatory:
1. Use the JavaScript Console to Check the Value of a Variable
2. Understanding the Differences between the freeCodeCamp and Browser Console
3. Use typeof to Check the Type of a Variable
4. Catch Misspelled Variable and Function Names
5. Catch Unclosed Parentheses, Brackets, Braces and Quotes
6. Catch Mixed Usage of Single and Double Quotes
7. Catch Use of Assignment Operator Instead of Equality Operator
8. Catch Missing Open and Closing Parenthesis After a Function Call
9. Catch Arguments Passed in the Wrong Order When Calling a Function
10. Catch Off By One Errors When Using Indexing
11. Use Caution When Reinitializing Variables Inside a Loop
12. Prevent Infinite Loops with a Valid Terminal Condition

That's it for today! Let's enjoy the weekend now :)
