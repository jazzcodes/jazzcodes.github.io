## WebD Basics (The End)

<p> In continuity with the previous post, I completed the WebD Basic Course after finishing up with the CSS part. These are some of the striking features I learnt!</p>   
1. <b>Gradients</b> <br>
<p> It's a cool feature in CSS that helps to create gradients of a wide variety of colors! Linear and Radial gradients add a really pretty effect to a webpage.</p>
2. <b>Color</b> <br>
<p>Learnt about different color options such as RGB (rgba), HSL (hsla), Hexadecimal approach. Each approach has its own advantage.</p>
3. <b>Shadows</b> <br>
<p>Shadows can applied to a container such as a product display or even to text which helps in ceating visually attractive interfaces. </p>
4. <b>Selectors</b> <br>
<p>Learnt about various selectors - id, class, element, pseudo, relational. These add to convenience in styling webpages. Also, became familiar with the concept of selector specificity.</p>

<p>In addition to these topics, I learnt about inheritance as well as border styling.</p>

<p>In order to refine what I learnt, I also covered the exercises given at the end of the course which is the best part I believe! :)</p>

Until next time!
